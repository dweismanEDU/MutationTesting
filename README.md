# Polynomial Class Mutation Testing Report

## Introduction
This report outlines the mutation testing process applied to the `Polynomial` class, which is designed to handle polynomial arithmetic and evaluation. Mutation testing is a fault-based testing technique used to evaluate the effectiveness of test cases. Mutpy was used for this mutation testing because of its ease of use with my python version and its effectiveness.

## Running Mutation Tests

To run the mutation tests in the code space, execute the following command in the terminal:

```shell
$ mut.py --target Polynomial --unit-test PolyTest --runner pytest --coverage --report-html detailed_report_dir
```

## List of Defined Mutation Operators
Mutation operators are modifications that simulate common errors introduced during development. For the `Polynomial` class, the following mutation operators were considered:

- **Arithmetic Operator Replacement (AOR)**: Changes arithmetic operators (e.g., `+` to `-`).
- **Conditional Operator Replacement (COR)**: Alters conditional operators (e.g., `>` to `<`).
- **Constant Replacement (CR)**: Modifies constant values in the code.
- **Statement Deletion (SD)**: Removes certain statements from the codebase.

## Description of Applied Mutations and Their Impact
Applied mutations included the alteration of arithmetic operations, changing constant values, and removing statements in method implementations. These mutations were intended to test the robustness of operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and evaluation of polynomials.

## Summary of Mutant Survival and Killing
Out of 74 total mutants generated by the MutPy framework, 44 were killed, 22 incompetent, and 8 survived, resulting in a mutation score of 84.6%. The survival of 8 mutants indicates areas where the test suite can be improved.

## Analysis of the Test Suite's Effectiveness
The test suite was effective in covering a wide range of scenarios, including polynomial initialization, string representation, arithmetic operations, and root finding. However, the survival of some mutants suggests that certain edge cases or conditions are not adequately tested. 

## Recommendations for Improving the Test Suite
To enhance the test suite, consider the following recommendations:

- **Implement Boundary Testing**: Focus on edge cases such as empty polynomials, very large coefficients, and polynomials with all zero coefficients.
- **Increase Condition Coverage**: Introduce tests that cover conditional branches, especially in methods like `find_root_bisection`.
- **Test Inverse Operations**: Verify operations such as adding and then subtracting the same polynomial, ensuring the result is a zero polynomial.
- **Evaluate at Various Points**: Extend evaluation tests to include negative, zero, and positive values, as well as non-integer numbers.

## Conclusion
Mutation testing has proven to be a valuable tool in assessing and improving the quality of the test suite for the `Polynomial` class. While the current test suite demonstrates substantial effectiveness, there is room for improvement to achieve a higher mutation score and ensure that potential defects would be caught during development.
